# VukelicEtAl2026_NigerGiraffeCMR_TempAndPrecip
This repository contains supporting data and R scripts for the capture-mark-recapture (CMR) analyses used to assess the effects of temperature and precipitation on apparent survival of the West African giraffe in the Giraffe Zone (2005–2018), implemented using multistate mark–recapture (MSMR) models. It also includes the Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts used to extract the climate covariates and the digitised habitat polygon (GeoJSON; derived from O’Connor et al., 2019) required to reproduce the climate data extraction workflow.
