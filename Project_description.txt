Folder: R
- contains R scripts

MSMR_temperature_GZ - Used to perform multistate mark-recapture (MSMR) analysis with temperature as a covariate (temperature is expressed as the number of days with maximum daily temperature equal or above 35°C, excluding December-February period).

GOF_MSMR_temperature - Used to create and export saturated global MSMR model with temperature as a covariate for the goodness of fit  analysis.

MSMR_precipitation_GZ - Used to perform multistate mark-recapture (MSMR) analysis with precipitation as a covariate (precipitation is expressed as total precipitation in months of June, July and August, JJA precipitation, in mm).

GOF_MSMR_precipitation - Used to create and export saturated global MSMR model with precipitation as a covariate for the goodness of fit  analysis.
